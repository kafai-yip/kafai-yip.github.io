I’m a first-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Yale University. I’m a Hongkonger and speak Cantonese. My research languages are mainly East Asian languages.

My main interests are syntax, semantics and their interface. Syntax is concerned the structure of language and semantics is concerned with the meaning of language. Their mapping is known as the syntax-semantics interface. Recently, I’m intrigued by the phenomenon of concord, where two elements are giving the same meaning, especially quantifier concord. Take negative concord as an example: *I did**n’t** eat **nothing*** may mean *I didn’t eat anything* in some varieties of English. Concord not only imposes problem on compositionality, a fundamental concept in semantics, but also sheds light on the syntax-semantics interface. Cantonese serves as an excellent empirical ground on this issue, where quantificational particles can often co-occur with other quantifiers (as well as focus markers & modals).

I’m also interested in syntax-phonology interface, especially supra-segmental phonology or prosody. Syntax is essentially a linking system of sound (or form) and meaning. To fully understand syntax, we need to look at the effects of both external components. There are at least two lines of research in East Asian languages: (i) The role of prosody, e.g. stress, in different constructions; (ii) the interaction of sentence-final-particles and intonation. Cantonese, again, being rich in SFPs and intonations (realized at the end of sentences – not the English kind!), offers useful evidence on the topics. 

Besides, my research is also concerned with methodologies of linguistics. If corpora and experiments can contribute to the empirical grounds of theoretical research – then why not? Please go to “Links” for a list of Cantonese corpora.

Outside academia, I’m a cat lover. I’ll update with my cat Tai Wong 大王 in Hong Kong irregularly. He was a stray in Sai Kung 西貢, eastern part in Hong Kong. Most of photo credit goes to my family. 

I go by both as Ka-Fai 家煇 ([ka55 fɐi55]) and Ming (my English name - though doesn’t sound Western).
