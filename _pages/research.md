## Focus

### *Exclusive doubling (diss.IP)*
My dissertation project in progress proposes a novel view on the mapping between morphosyntax and semantics to provide a principled explanation for quantifier doubling, with a special focus on doubling of exclusive focus particles (literally “John only bought lamb only”, meaning ‘John only bought lamb'). Quantifier doubling refers to cases where two quantifier expressions occur in a sentence, but apparently only one is interpreted as logical quantification. I hypothesize that quantifier doubling is a syntactic manifestation (“syntacticization”) of quantification structures that are otherwise lexicalized as a whole in languages without doubling. Specifically, I pursue the proposal that exclusive doubling involves a scalar exclusive meaning, which is mapped onto two syntactically linked exclusive focus particles: one denotes an exclusive operator on the at-issue semantic dimension, and the other encodes a scalar reading on the not-at-issue dimension. These two meaning pieces are realized together on one lexical item in non-doubling languages.

The doubling languages that I plan to work on in the dissertation: Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese; Akan, Yoruba; Japanese; Dutch, German.

My current committee members are: Veneeta Dayal (chair), Zoltán Gendler Szabó, Raffaella Zanuttini, and Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine (external).

Below is some work I've done in the past (and ongoing):

While it is not the main focus of my dissertation, my "first love" in quantifier doubling is universal concord. Below is some earlier work from my bachelor/MPhil research.

{% capture notice-text %}
* I show that universal elements also have concord, on a par with negative concord. Focusing on the suffix *-can* 'whenever' in Cantonese and *mei...dou* 'every' in Mandarin, I argue for a syntactic agreement analysis of universal concord. I also discuss the relevance of minimality effects.

* A related discussion on the scopal behaviour of the verbal suffix *-can* 'whenever' in Cantonese.

### *Focus and modal*

{% capture notice-text %}
[with [Tommy Tsz-Ming LEE](https://tszminglee.github.io/)]
* We propose that root modals in Chinese can undergo movement when crossing a focused element, and the movement is constrained by output economy regarding focus set calculation.

## Syntax & semantics

### *Hyperraising*

{% capture notice-text %}
[with [Tommy Tsz-Ming LEE](https://tszminglee.github.io/)]
* We show that raising out of a finite clause (i.e. hyperraising) is correlated with indirect evidence cross-linguistically, and how the correlation may be accounted for under a phase-deactivation approach.

{% capture notice-text %}
[with [Magdalena Lohninger](https://lenalohninger.wordpress.com/)]
* We argue that features on Composite Probes may be dependent or independent of each other, which is supported by a typological correlation between  semantic restrictions in cross-clausal A-dependencies and blockage of additional A’-movement.

### *Adverbial clauses*

{% capture notice-text %}
[with [Zhuo Chen](https://www.zhuochenlinguist.com/)]
* We argue that adverbial clauses may be derived by either operator movement or merging an in-situ operator at the highest CP. These two strategies are attested in both central and peripheral adverbial clauses, calling for a finer typology of adverbial clauses.

* A related discussion on reducing the external syntax to the internal syntax in terms of operator merging sites.

{% capture notice-text %}
* I investigate 11 Cantonese converbs (i.e. affixes that only occur in adverbial clauses) and show that converbal clauses conform with the central-peripheral distinction just as regular adverbial clauses.

### *Copy Deletion*

{% capture notice-text %}
[with [Sheila Shu-Laam CHAN](https://sheilaslchan.github.io/) & [Tommy Tsz-Ming LEE](https://tszminglee.github.io/)]
* Focusing on discontinuous predicates, we propose that Copy Deletion may interact with syllable deletion and apply partially. Micro-variations between Cantonese and Mandarin are also addressed.

{% capture notice-text %}
[with [Comfort Ahenkorah](https://ling.yale.edu/people/comfort-ahenkorah)]
* Drawing evidence from non-agreeing resumptive pronouns, we argue that Copy Deletion can apply in a partial fashion and spell out the lower copy of a movement chain as default pronouns.
