## Focus

### *Exclusive doubling*
My dissertation project in progress proposes a novel view on the mapping between morphosyntax and semantics to provide a principled explanation for quantifier doubling, with a special focus on doubling of exclusive focus particles (literally “John only bought lamb only”, meaning ‘John only bought lamb'). Quantifier doubling refers to cases where two quantifier expressions occur in a sentence, but apparently only one is interpreted as logical quantification. I hypothesize that quantifier doubling is a syntactic manifestation (“syntacticization”) of quantification structures that are otherwise lexicalized as a whole in languages without doubling. Specifically, I pursue the proposal that exclusive doubling involves a scalar exclusive meaning, which is mapped onto two syntactically linked exclusive focus particles: one denotes an exclusive operator on the at-issue semantic dimension, and the other encodes a scalar reading on the not-at-issue dimension. These two meaning pieces are realized together on one lexical item in non-doubling languages.

The doubling languages that I plan to work on in the dissertation: Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese; Akan, Yoruba; Japanese; Dutch, German.

My current committee members are: Veneeta Dayal (chair), Zoltán Gendler Szabó, Raffaella Zanuttini, and Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine (external).

Below is some work I've done in the past (and ongoing):

**Exclusive doubling** `syntax-semantics`

While it is not the main focus of my dissertation, my "first love" in quantifier doubling is universal concord. Below is some earlier work from my bachelor/MPhil research.

{% capture notice-text %}
**Universal concord** `syntax-semantics`

* I show that universal elements also have concord, on a par with negative concord. Focusing on the suffix *-can* 'whenever' in Cantonese and *mei...dou* 'every' in Mandarin, I argue for a syntactic agreement analysis of universal concord. I also discuss the relevance of minimality effects.

* A related discussion on the scopal behaviour of the verbal suffix *-can* 'whenever' in Cantonese.

### *Defocus and prosody*

{% capture notice-text %}
**Right dislocation (RD)** `syntax-prosody`

* I argue for a biclausal approach to RD in Chinese that unifies gapped and gapless/copying variants.
    - Cantonese, Mandarin｜[paper-ms](https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/007912)
* `[with [Xuetong Yuan](https://kathyuan28.github.io/)]` We propose a novel defocus rephrasing view where the prosodic role of defocus is distinguished from focus. We motivate this view with a case study on syntax-prosody mismatches in RD in Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as cross-linguistic variations in the prosodic phrasing of RD.

### *Focus and modal*

{% capture notice-text %}
**Modal movement licensed by focus** `syntax`

* `[with [Tommy Tsz-Ming LEE](https://tszminglee.github.io/)]` We propose that root modals in Chinese can undergo movement when crossing a focused element, and the movement is constrained by output economy regarding focus set calculation.

## Syntax & semantics

### *Hyperraising*

{% capture notice-text %}
**Hyperraising, evidentiality and phase deactivation** `syntax` 

* `[with [Tommy Tsz-Ming Lee](https://tszminglee.github.io/)]` We show that raising out of a finite clause (i.e. hyperraising) is correlated with indirect evidence cross-linguistically, and how the correlation may be accounted for under a phase-deactivation approach.

{% capture notice-text %}
**(In)dependence of features on composite probes** `syntax` 

* `with [Magdalena Lohninger](https://lenalohninger.wordpress.com/)]` We argue that features on Composite Probes may be dependent or independent of each other, which is supported by a typological correlation between  semantic restrictions in cross-clausal A-dependencies and blockage of additional A’-movement.

### *Adverbial clauses*

{% capture notice-text %}
**Internal syntax** `syntax`

* `[with [Zhuo Chen](https://www.zhuochenlinguist.com/)]` We argue that adverbial clauses may be derived by either operator movement or merging an in-situ operator at the highest CP. These two strategies are attested in both central and peripheral adverbial clauses, calling for a finer typology of adverbial clauses.

**Converbs** `syntax`

* I investigate 11 Cantonese converbs (i.e. affixes that only occur in adverbial clauses) and show that converbal clauses conform with the central-peripheral distinction just as regular adverbial clauses.

### *Copy Deletion*

{% capture notice-text %}
**Discontinuous predicates** `syntax`

* `[with [Tommy Tsz-Ming Lee](https://tszminglee.github.io/)] & [Sheila Shu-Laam Chan](https://sheilaslchan.github.io/)]` Focusing on discontinuous predicates, we propose that Copy Deletion may interact with syllable deletion and apply partially. Micro-variations between Cantonese and Mandarin are also addressed.

{% capture notice-text %}
**Non-agreeing resumptive pronouns (NRPs)** `syntax`

* `[with [Comfort Ahenkorah](https://ling.yale.edu/people/comfort-ahenkorah)]` Drawing evidence from NRPs, we argue that Copy Deletion can apply in a partial fashion and spell out the lower copy of a movement chain as default pronouns.

* `[with [Xuetong Yuan](https://kathyuan28.github.io/)]` We argue that NRPs in Mandarin establish an Agree relation with an imperative/jussive head, and partial Copy Deletion arises from the interaction between the Agree and movement dependencies.

### *Typology of definiteness*

{% capture notice-text %}
**Quasi-names** `semantics`

* `[with [Ushasi Banerjee](https://ling.yale.edu/people/ushasi-banerjee) & [Margaret Chui Yi Lee](https://linguistics.uconn.edu/person/margaret-chui-yi-lee/)]` We motivate a new view on the typology of definiteness that integrates (quasi-)names. We argue that unique bare nominals in bare classifier languages are name-like expressions rather than definite descriptions. We propose that quasi-names, as well as proper names, are derived by a definite determiner that encodes a functional relation between the discourse participants and the referent.
